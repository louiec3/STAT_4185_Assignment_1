Quote: "An issue with current data science methodologies is that the impact of contextual awareness is underestimated since the problem is much more complex. At times we incorrectly equate correlation with causation based on incomplete data or lack of understanding sensitive dependencies between data sets."

I think this quote simply means that just because we see a trend through data analysis, you need to understand the context of what is going on before drawing final conclusions.
